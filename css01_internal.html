Twitter has sued the Indian <strong>government to challenge</strong> some of the block orders on tweets and accounts, further escalating the tension in the key overseas market.
In its lawsuit, <span id="txt">filed Tuesday</span> in the Karnataka High Court in Bengaluru, Twitter alleges that New Delhi had abused its power by ordering it to arbitrarily and disproportionately remove several tweets from its platform.
<b>Additionally</b>, some block <span class="a">orders</span> “pertain to political content that is posted by official handles of political parties,” Twitter said in the lawsuit.
“Blocking of such information is <span class="a">a violation</span> of the freedom of speech guaranteed to citizen-users of the platform. Further, the content at issue does not have any apparent proximate relationship to the grounds under Section 69A,” it argued.
